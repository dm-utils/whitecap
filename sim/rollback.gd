class_name Rollback
extends RefCounted
## Rollback netcode for online matches (phase 12a). Each screen runs the whole match itself; only player input travels.
## Own input is scheduled `delay` ticks ahead (less to roll back). Another player's input that hasn't arrived yet is
## predicted (their last known input). When real input arrives for a tick that was already played with a different
## prediction, the match goes back to a snapshot of that tick and is played again up to now. Because the sim and
## the bots are deterministic, every screen ends in the same state once all input is known.
## No network here: the caller moves `outbox` messages to the others and feeds what arrives into remote_input().
